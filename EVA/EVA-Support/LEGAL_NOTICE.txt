EVA - An open source modification of the Windows 10 operating system reformed for performance, privacy & latency.
-------------------------------------------------------------
EVA is a free iso created by amit aimed for low latency gaming
and privacy. It is developed for educational purposes only, 
which emphasizes an effort to reverse engineer and disable
components of the Microsoft Windows 10 operating system.
The goal is to better understand and mitigate the collection
of Personally Identifiable information and improve peformance
of Windows by disabling components included within it.
-------------------------------------------------------------
DISTRIBUTION
This iso is offered free of charge, and should only be
downloaded from an official source. Please report abuse.
Commercial distribution is strictly prohibited by law.

EU Directive 2009/24, on the legal protection of computer programs, 
governs reverse engineering in the European Union. The directive states:

"(15) The unauthorised reproduction, translation, adaptation or transformation 
of the form of the code in which a copy of a computer program has been made 
available constitutes an infringement of the exclusive rights of the author. 
Nevertheless, circumstances may exist when such a reproduction of the code and 
translation of its form are indispensable to obtain the necessary information 
to achieve the interoperability of an independently created program with other
programs. It has therefore to be considered that, in these limited circumstances
only, performance of the acts of reproduction and translation by or on behalf 
of a person having a right to use a copy of the program is legitimate 
and compatible with fair practice and must therefore be deemed not to require
the authorisation of the rightholder. An objective of this exception is to
make it possible to connect all components of a computer system, including 
those of different manufacturers, so that they can work together. Such an 
exception to the author's exclusive rights may not be used in a way which
prejudices the legitimate interests of the rightholder or which conflicts 
with a normal exploitation of the program."

The intentions as self-described by EVA's Windows projects, clearly fall under the
case-scenario of enabling better "interoperability", as the prevalence of proprietary
software bundled with the Windows operating system does not constitute an open standard 
in this regard.
